## Introduction

The Perceptron Learning Algorithm is a simple yet powerful algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It works by finding a hyperplane that separates two classes in a linearly separable dataset.

## Dataset Generation

The dataset used in this project is generated randomly and is linearly separable. The dataset generation process involves creating random points and assigning labels based on a target hyperplane.

## Perceptron Learning Algorithm

The Perceptron Learning Algorithm iteratively adjusts the weights of the model to minimize classification errors. The algorithm continues until all points are correctly classified or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Results

The results of the Perceptron Learning Algorithm are visualized through plots. These plots show the target function and the learned hypothesis after the algorithm has converged.
